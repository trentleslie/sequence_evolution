# Evo 2: Genome modeling and design across all domains of life

![Evo 2](evo2.jpg)

Evo 2 is a state of the art DNA language model for long context modeling and design. Evo 2 models DNA sequences at single-nucleotide resolution at up to 1 million base pair context length using the [StripedHyena 2](https://github.com/Zymrael/vortex) architecture. Evo 2 was pretrained using [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna). Evo 2 was trained autoregressively on [OpenGenome2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arcinstitute/opengenome2), a dataset containing 8.8 trillion tokens from all domains of life.

We describe Evo 2 in the preprint:
["Genome modeling and design across all domains of life with Evo 2"](https://arcinstitute.org/manuscripts/Evo2).

## Setup

### Requirements

Evo 2 is based on [StripedHyena 2](https://github.com/Zymrael/vortex). A CUDA-capable system is required to build and install the prerequisites. Evo 2 uses [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), which may not work on all GPU architectures. Please consult the [FlashAttention GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention#installation-and-features) for the current list of supported GPUs. 

### Installation

Please clone and install from GitHub. We recommend using a conda environment with Pytorch. Requires python>=3.11.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ArcInstitute/evo2.git
cd evo2
pip install .
```

If this did not work for whatever reason, you can also install from [Vortex](https://github.com/Zymrael/vortex) and follow the instructions there. PyPi support coming soon!

You can check that the installation was correct by running a test.

```
python ./test/test_evo2.py --model_name evo2_7b
```

## Checkpoints

We provide the following model checkpoints, hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/arcinstitute):
| Checkpoint Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| `evo2_40b`  | A model pretrained with 1 million context obtained through context extension of `evo2_40b_base`.|
| `evo2_7b`  | A model pretrained with 1 million context obtained through context extension of `evo2_7b_base`.|
| `evo2_40b_base`  | A model pretrained with 8192 context length.|
| `evo2_7b_base`  | A model pretrained with 8192 context length.|
| `evo2_1b_base`  | A smaller model pretrained with 8192 context length.|

To use Evo 2 40B, you will need multiple GPUs. Vortex automatically handles device placement, splitting the model across available cuda devices.

## Usage

Below are simple examples of how to download Evo 2 and use it locally using Python.

### Forward

Evo 2 can be used to score the likelihoods across a DNA sequence.

```python
import torch
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

sequence = 'ACGT'
input_ids = torch.tensor(
    evo2_model.tokenizer.tokenize(sequence),
    dtype=torch.int,
).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda:0')

outputs, _ = evo2_model(input_ids)
logits = outputs[0]

print('Logits: ', logits)
print('Shape (batch, length, vocab): ', logits.shape)
```

### Embeddings

Evo 2 embeddings can be saved for use downstream.

```python
import torch
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

sequence = 'ACGT'
input_ids = torch.tensor(
    evo2_model.tokenizer.tokenize(sequence),
    dtype=torch.int,
).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda:0')

layer_name = 'blocks.28.mlp.l3'

outputs, embeddings = evo2_model(input_ids, return_embeddings=True, layer_names=[layer_name])

print('Embeddings shape: ', embeddings[layer_name].shape)
```

### Generation

Evo 2 can generate DNA sequences based on prompts.

```python
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

output = evo2_model.generate(prompt_seqs=["ACGT"], n_tokens=400, temperature=1.0, top_k=4)

print(output.sequences[0])
```

### Notebooks

We provide an example [notebook](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/blob/main/notebooks/brca1/brca1_zero_shot_vep.ipynb) of zero-shot *BRCA1* variant effect prediction. This example includes a walkthrough of:
- Performing zero-shot *BRCA1* variant effect predictions using Evo 2
- Reference vs alternative allele normalization

### Very long sequences

We are actively working on optimizing performance for long sequence processing. Vortex can currently compute over very long sequences via teacher prompting. However please note that forward pass on long sequences may currently be slow. 

## Dataset

The OpenGenome2 dataset used for pretraining Evo2 is available on [HuggingFace ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arcinstitute/opengenome2). Data is available either as raw fastas or as JSONL files which include preprocessing and data augmentation.

## Training Code

Evo 2 was trained using [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna), an open source framework for training alternative architectures.
